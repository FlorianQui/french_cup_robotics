In order to compile and execute c++ node with ros, we have to set the Catkin make package up.

Here is an example to compiling and executing it using rosrun.
Make sure you've launch roscore before in an annex terminal.

- We first need to create the package : 
	cd ~/catkin_ws/src #move to the catkin directory
	catkin_create_pkg myPackageName roscpp std_msgs genmsg #create the new pkg named myPackageName
	cm #if no errors after catkin make, the pkg has been successfully created

- Create the c++ file
	cs
	roscd myPackageName/src
	mkdir scripts launch
	cd scripts
	nano myCppFile.cpp and write down :
		
		#import "ros/ros.h"
		int main(int argc, char **argv){
			return 0;
		}
	
	roscd myPackageName
	nano CMakeLists.txt
	
	Get down to "BUILD" and uncomment include in the include_directories
	Get down and uncomment add_executable
	Still in add_executable alter add_executable( myCppFile src/scripts/myCppFile.cpp )
	Get down and uncomment target_link_libraries and alter target_link_libraries( myCppFile.cpp ${catkin_LIBRARIES} )

- "Make" it and run the executable
	cm
	rosrun myPackageName
